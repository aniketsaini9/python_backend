# ARCHITECTURE.md — LILA BLACK Player Journey Visualization Tool

**Live Tool:** https://lila-frontend-assignment.vercel.app/
**Frontend Repo:** https://github.com/aniketsaini9/Lila_frontend_assignment
**Backend Repo:** https://github.com/aniketsaini9/python_backend
**Backend API:** https://python-backend-lila.onrender.com/

## What I Built and Why

| Layer | Choice | Why |
|---|---|---|
| Data pipeline | Python + PyArrow + Pandas | Same language as the parquet tooling; no translation layer needed |
| Backend | FastAPI | Auto OpenAPI docs, async support, minimal boilerplate for a read-only API |
| Frontend | React + TypeScript + Tailwind | Component model maps cleanly to UI structure; TypeScript catches API contract mismatches at compile time |
| Backend hosting | Render.com | Supports persistent uvicorn processes — Vercel serverless cannot run long-running servers |
| Frontend hosting | Vercel | Purpose-built for React; global CDN; zero-config deploy from GitHub |

  ├── Bot detection via UUID v4 regex pattern
  ├── World coords → pixel coords (per-map calibration)
  ├── Timestamps normalized per match (0ms → duration ms)
  └── Output → events.json, matches.json, summary.json

## Coordinate Mapping — The Tricky Part

Raw events store positions in Unreal Engine world space (float units). Minimap images are 1024×1024 pixels. Each map has a different scale and origin requiring individual calibration:

```python
MAP_CONFIG = {
    "AmbroseValley": {"scale": 900,  "origin_x": -370, "origin_z": -473},
    "GrandRift":     {"scale": 581,  "origin_x": -290, "origin_z": -290},
    "Lockdown":      {"scale": 1000, "origin_x": -500, "origin_z": -500},
}

def world_to_pixel(x, z, map_id):
    u = (x - origin_x) / scale      # normalize x → 0..1
    v = (z - origin_z) / scale      # normalize z → 0..1
    pixel_x = u * 1024
    pixel_y = (1 - v) * 1024        # flip Y axis: screen top-left vs world bottom-left
```

**Key decision:** The raw data has `x`, `y`, `z` axes where `y` is elevation (3D height). It is intentionally discarded — this is a top-down 2D minimap. `x` maps to horizontal pixel space and `z` maps to vertical pixel space after Y-axis flip.

The SVG overlay uses `viewBox="0 0 1024 1024"` with `preserveAspectRatio="xMidYMid meet"`, which means event dots rendered at pixel coordinates align correctly regardless of the container's screen dimensions.

## Assumptions Made

| Ambiguity | Assumption Made |
|---|---|
| Bot vs human detection | UUID v4 format = human; all other ID formats = bot |
| Timestamp format | Raw `ts` is epoch nanoseconds from Pandas Timestamp; converted to ms via `// 1_000_000` before normalization |
| Coordinate calibration | Scale and origin values derived by fitting known map extents to 1024×1024 pixel space |
| Zone names | Minimap images have no zone metadata; labels are approximated from visual inspection of the minimap images |
| Match ID cleaning | Raw match IDs carry `.nakama-0` suffix from Nakama game server — stripped during pipeline processing |
| BotKill vs Kill | Treated as equivalent kill events for heatmap and choke point analysis; distinguished visually by marker style |

---

## Major Trade-offs

| Decision | Considered | Decided | Why |
|---|---|---|---|
| Storage: in-memory JSON vs database | SQLite, PostgreSQL, DuckDB | In-memory JSON | 89K events fits in RAM; eliminates query latency; no DB setup for a read-only dataset |
| Filtering: server-side vs client-side | Full server filtering per request | Backend filters + up to 10K events per match to frontend | Keeps frontend logic simple; 10K events per match is manageable in browser memory |
| Timestamp normalization | Pipeline only vs frontend only | Pipeline + frontend safety layer | Pipeline is authoritative; frontend layer handles any edge cases from unnormalized data |
| Heatmap: default on vs off | Show immediately | Off by default | Heatmap fetches all kill events across all matches — large payload; avoids unnecessary load on first render |
| Backend: serverless vs persistent | Vercel Functions, Railway | Render persistent web service | FastAPI + uvicorn + StaticFiles for minimap images requires a long-running process; serverless cannot serve static files the same way |

## Scalability Considerations

At 10× data scale (~900K events):
- In-memory loading becomes impractical → migrate to PostgreSQL with composite indexes on `(match_id, map_id, date)`
- `/api/events` needs spatial indexing or pre-aggregated tile grids rather than raw coordinate arrays
- `process.py` pipeline can be parallelized across days using Python `multiprocessing`
- Heatmap should be pre-computed server-side into density grids rather than sending raw coordinates to the frontend

---

## Future Improvements

- **Custom data upload** — `/api/upload` endpoint accepting `.parquet` files; the pipeline in `process.py` is already modular and could run as a FastAPI `BackgroundTask`
- **User-defined zones** — Let designers draw and label map zones directly on the minimap
- **Cross-match aggregation** — Identify consistent choke points across many matches vs single-match outliers
- **Player tracking** — Click a player path to isolate their complete journey and event history
- **CSV export** — Download filtered event data for external analysis in spreadsheet tools
